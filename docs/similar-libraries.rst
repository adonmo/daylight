PyEphem
-------
GitHub: https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem

PyEphem is, comparatively, a much more sophisticated and full-blown
astronomical engine daylight, on the other hand, is focused on much
smaller subset of problems

pvlib-python
------------
GitHub: https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python

Aimed at photovoltaic energy system development, it includes many
things which you might not need, so if your use cases is to just
compute brightness levels of the day - it could be an overkill

Additionally, it is written in pure python, compared to daylight which
benifits from the portability and efficiency of a C++ based implementation

solarpy
-------
GitHub: https://github.com/aqreed/solarpy

- Can calculate for any orientation of surface plane
- Seems to only consider latitude when computing irradiance levels
- Written in pure python
